### Write-Up

This project uses Hibernate to access and write to a mySQL database. Servlets were used to make a pseudo login utilizing Tomcat to serve up simple HTML pages. After logging in the user is given a text box to input an id which corresponds to the item id of the drink in the database. After an item is inputed a screen is shown showing the corresponding drink and its price and other info. If no drink exists for the id then no item found is shown.
